In the first stage of the project I was learning the Juce API and reading through its tutorials. I've configured the project in VS 2019 and compiled the necessary source code using CMake. I was using the Projucer to generate the VS Project. As of now I was able to build a simple VST with no GUI that inputs audio and modifies the volume of output. Everything is going smoothly and I think that at the next stage i will have a VST that will modify the audio wave and add some GUI.
