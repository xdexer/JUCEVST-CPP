# JUCEVST-CPP
My first attempt in creating VST, my goal is to create a software synthesizer or an audio effect, to further my knowledge about sound synthesis and 
audio programming.

Project will be made solely with JUCE framework for creating multi-platform audio applications. The result will be a VST with GUI that can be
used in many popular DAWs, e.g. FL Studio, Ableton Live and many more.

Project Schedule (can be changed):

16.10 - 3.11 - doing JUCE tutorials and learning the API 

4.11 - 17.11 - creating first prototype of some VST and having fun with some loose ideas

18.11 - 01.12 - deciding whether to do an audio effect or a software synthesizer, jugded by level of complication and time that is needed 

02.12 - 15.12 - creating VST of choice and making it fully working

16.12 - 12.01 - implementing extra functions, GUI and polishing it

13.01 - 02.02 - finishing the project and making a final version with an example of using the VST
